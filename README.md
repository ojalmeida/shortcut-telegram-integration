## How to deploy

1 - Docker Compose

```bash

git clone https://github.com/ojalmeida/shortcut-telegram-integration.git

cd shortcut-telegram-integration/deploy

# edit environment variables (mandatory)
vim (or nano) compose/docker-compose.yaml

make deploy-compose

```

2 - Kubernetes (TODO)

## How to integrate

After deploy in a publicly reachable environment, you will need to configure Clubhouse's Shortcut Webhook integration

What can be done in a link like this: https://app.shortcut.com/{organization_name}/settings/integrations/outgoing-webhook

Set webhook as: `http(s)://{domain or IP}/webhook`

> Webhook service listens for requests in /webhook endpoint

## How to use

1. Send `/start` in configured Telegram BOT, you'll receive the following message:

2. Send `/auth {authorization_token}` to be able to properly interact with service, where `{authorization_token}` is a 32 characters long hexadecimal string

> If TELEGRAM_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN was not set as an environment variable on bot's containers/pods its default value is `21f4257178c7cde44926b16f1482e2bf`

3. Send `/subscribe @{your_shortcut_mention_name}`, this command will enable notification when a review it's asked you

4. Asks for review in a Clubhouse's Shortcut :

5. If, in this case, `fulano` is already subscribed in bot, he will receive a message like this, every two hours (there is a way to configure this):

6. If `fulano` click in `Review feito` button, you'll receive a message like this:

![img.png](images/review-done.png)

6.1. If `fulano` does not want to be bothered with this review anymore, he can click in "NÃ£o notificar" and the notifications to this review will stop, he will be able to signalize that the review as done yet though.

7. If `fulano` or you do not want to receive notifications at all, the `/unsubscribe` command its available

8. If `fulano` or you changed yours Clubhouse's Shortcut name you can update it in the bot via `/update @{new_username}`

## The bot it's not sending review notifications, why ?

Things to check:

1. Check if the url provided in Clubhouse's Shortcut Webhook is right, try `curl` to it
2. Make sure that the user that review was requested is subscribed to bot (see "How to use") 
3. Make sure that your comment in story matches the regexp: `.*\breview\b.*` (https://regexr.com, if you need it)

Well, if everything is OK, please open an issue and explain your problem, I will be glad to help.
